The game will provides a graphical animation of moving disc from the leftmost pin to the rightmost one.
The user controls the speed of the animation and how many discs to use. Also, there's controls stop, start, 
and reset the animation.

The app is written using 'portable' HTML5 that will work in all major browsers (including IE8). This makes
it easy to create a hybrid version of the app, i.e. a native webview wrapped version.
